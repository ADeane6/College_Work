1. Structures and Data hiding
	Download hidingVars.cpp, run it and explain what is happening

2. StructParameter.
	Explain the output of 2.structparameters.cpp
	Explain diff in output between 2.structparameters.cpp and 3.structparameters.cpp

3. Convert all structs to classes.
	Are there other changes you need to make?
	What is the effect?

4. Look up stack frames in C++
	Use this to explain why memory works the way it does.

5. Constructors

6. What will CDDate2 print and why?
	What is a default constructor?

	Why is it 
		CDDate day;
	and not
		CDDate day();
	to call default constructor?

7. How would you make it so you can't call the default constructor.

8. No constructor
	CDDate3.cpp

	What would happen if day and month were private?

9. Look at CDDate4.cpp
	When the default constructor is commented out, then the program doesn't compile.
	Why is that?

10. Write code that demonstrates understanding of static variables.
