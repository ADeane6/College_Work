Function Signatures
===================

Here is an interesting problem that can occur with C programs but not with C++ programs.

Download the files minmain.c and min.c

min.c just contains a function called min. It prints out its arguments and returns the smallest
argument. It can be compiled to min.o. Use the line
	gcc -c min.c

minmain.c calls min(), but it assumes that it has only one parameter! (This is a serious error.)

It can still be compiled and executed and there is no warning because the prototype in minmain.c matches the function call in minmain, but not the actual function in min.c

So, compile minmain.c
	gcc -o minmain minmain.c min.o

Now run minmain:
	./minmain

Explain the results.
